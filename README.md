# GIA numeracy practice test
    
You will be presented with 20 sets of three numbers. For each set of numbers, find the middle number.
Then select the number furthest away from that number.

For example, in the set [4,2,8] the middle number is 4.
The difference between 2 and 4 is 2, and the difference between 4 and 8 is 4.
Here, the winning number is 8.

In the instance that two numbers have an equal value, choose the highest.

You will be tested for speed as well as accuracy. 
Please complete each set in under 5 seconds.
